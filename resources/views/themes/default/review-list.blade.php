                        <p>My wife (57y old) and I (63y) did the Everest Base Camp Trek between Oct 28- Nov 8, which was
                            expected to be a dry season. Unfortunately, we suffered many rains in the first 4 days and
                            could only see the Himalayas mountains when we reached Deboche. Luckily, the rest days were
                            clear, which allowed us to enjoy the stunning mountain views.</p>
                        <p>A huge part of our successful journey goes to our guide, Vishnu Bhatta. He was a genuinely
                            kind and thoughtful person. His steady encouragement, patience, and support were
                            instrumental in helping us complete the trek comfortably and confidently.</p>

                        <p>My husband (52 years old) and I (50 years old) completed the Everest Base Camp Trek from
                            April 6 to April 18. The weather was mostly clear, though we experienced some light snow
                            around Dingboche. Despite the challenges, the views of Everest, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam were
                            breathtaking and made every step worthwhile.</p>
                        <p>Our guide, <b>Pemba Sherpa</b>, played a vital role in our success. He was extremely caring,
                            knowledgeable, and always attentive to our pace and well-being. His encouragement and
                            positive attitude kept our spirits high throughout the trek. </p>

                        <p>I (45 years old) joined the Everest Base Camp Trek from March 22 to April 3 as a solo
                            traveler. While the trail was busy in some sections, the overall experience was incredibly
                            rewarding. The gradual ascent allowed proper acclimatization, and the mountain scenery was
                            beyond my expectations.</p>
                        <p>I am especially grateful to our guide, <b>Lakpa Tamang</b>, whose professionalism and calm
                            demeanor made the trek smooth and enjoyable. He was always ready to help and share insights
                            about local culture and the region. </p>
